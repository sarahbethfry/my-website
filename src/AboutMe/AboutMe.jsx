          Hello! I am Sarah. I have always had a passion for problem-solving,
          organization, and creating solutions. After gaining my B.S. in
          Advertising Communications at St. Johnâ€™s University in New York City,
          I had ambitions of living the fast paced New York ad lifestyle, but
          quickly realized this world was not for me. Leveraging my skills as a
          buyer in advertising, I found a more fulfilling career in the
          veterinary world as the purchasing manager for a large specialty and
          emergency vet hospital. This job taught me a lot about myself, mainly
          how much I enjoyed solving technical issues. I became a mother in 2018
          and decided to leave the workforce and stay home with my son. This
          time at home allowed me to explore new career opportunities. After
          taking an online Intro to Python course through city college, I fell
          in love with coding and all the possibilities it creates. After
          Hackbright, I hope to find a job where she can contribute my passion
          for building dynamic, clean, user-friendly applications.
